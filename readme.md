## Grayson API

This is a python wrapper designed to work with the Robin room management service (find out more at: https://robinpowered.com/ ). 

This is being done as a personal project and without the support of the Robin staff.

# Feature List:

* Logs you into the Robin API (you need a valid API key and your organization name to do this.)

* Get a user list for your organization

* Add a user to your organization

* Get a list of locations in your organization.

* Get a list of amenities in your organization.

* More coming soon. 

All of this is very rough right now.

# Example of use:

I'll update this with examples of this in use in the very near future.
